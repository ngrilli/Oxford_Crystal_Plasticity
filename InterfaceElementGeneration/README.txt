PyCiGen generates cohesive interface elements at the grain boundaries
starting from an abaqus input file

If damage model (UEL) is coupled with phase field in the bulk elements
(for instance twin phase field) then check instructions in
./PhaseFieldCoupling

To put cohesive elements everywhere in the geometry
check the instructions in:
./CohesiveElementsEverywhere
