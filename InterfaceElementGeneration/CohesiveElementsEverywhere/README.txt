Instructions to generate the mesh ond cohesive elements are in
CohesiveEverywhere.pdf

First generate the geometry .geo file

Then generate the .msh file

Apply ciGEN software to generate cohesive elements everywhere
These will not have the right node orientations
as explained in:

N. Grilli, E. Tarleton, A.C.F. Cocks
Coupling twin phase field modelling and cohesive elements to understand 
twin-induced fracture
(submitted manuscript)

Therefore they must be reoriented using the CohesiveElementsCheck.py
script

At the beginning of the script set the names of the
node, bulk elements and interface element files generated by ciGEN:

nodefilename = 'Square20umEl0p25-node.inp'
bulkelemfilename = 'Square20umEl0p25-bulk-elems.inp'
intelemfilename = 'Square20umEl0p25-int-elems.inp'

Then run
python CohesiveElementsCheck.py

The new interface elements with the correct node orientation
will be generated in the file specified at the end of the 
CohesiveElementsCheck.py script, for instance:

'Job-1-int-elem-new.inp'

These are the interface elements that must be included in the 
Abaqus input file, see for instance:
Job-2.inp

GenerateBoundarySets.py is a useful script to generate the
boundary sets needed to apply boundary conditions without importing
the mesh in abaqus

Set the name of the node file at the beginning of the script,
for instance:
nodefilename = 'Square20umEl0p25-node.inp'

The output will be in the file indicated at the line:

# write node sets for the assembly
fid = open('Job-1-node-sets.inp','w')
